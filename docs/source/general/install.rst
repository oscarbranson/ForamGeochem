Installation
============

``foramgeochem`` is available as a Python package, and can be installed from a terminal window using ``pip``::

    pip install foramgeochem

This requires a working Python installation. If you don't have one, are unsure if you do, try installing the `Anaconda Python Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_, which should include everything you need to get started.
